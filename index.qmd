Welcome to the 2025 workshop on machine learning (ML) in seismology, where we will
learn, try out, and develop ML tools for use at NORSAR. 

Slides, exercises and other material will be kept on this webpage for later reference.
If you have suggestions for additions or improvements, submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/smaeland/norsar-ml-workshop/pulls)!
