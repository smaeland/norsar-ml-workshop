DAY 1

Start with exercise. STA vs LTA, and a (pretrained?) ML classifier 

ML intro:

- ML vs AI
- different ML tasks (classification, etc)
- traditional counterparts
	- detection: STA/LTA vs anomaly detection
	- cross-correlation -> segue into convolution

- filling the gap between "no pattern match, just amplitude" (sta/lta) to "complete match" (xcorrelation)


- metrics

- unsupervised learning 



DAY 2

- notable papers




Kaggle challenge ??
