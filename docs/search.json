To complete the test, click here to open our first exercise, and click through it (takes 2 min, tops). If you do not have/want a Google account, take a look at the other options listed in Section 4.0.3.\nRead some of the background material in Section 3, especially the first of the review articles, to get some inspiration to what tasks can be solved with modern machine learning.\nThink about topics or ideas to you would like to discuss or even prototype during the workshop. Around half of day 2 will be dedicated to exploring new projects.\n\n\nOptional\nIn addition to the points above, it will be helpful for the exercises we have planned to take a look at the technical stuff in Section 4, and run though the various tutorials to get comfortable with Python and its libraries. We will do a quickstart on the first day of the workshop as well, but doing it beforehand is a lot more efficient."

    "text": "Technical things\nDuring the workshop we will do various hands-on exercises, most of which benefit from some experience with programming. Luckily, the de-facto programming language for machine learning is Python, which is relatively easy to get started with.\nThere are three pieces of tech we will be using:\n\nPython, the programming langage,\nPython libraries, containing code to actually do stuff, and\nJupyter notebooks, which is a convenient way of running Python.\n\nThe magic of 3. is that you do not need to install anything, instead we run the code online, in a browser. Below follows an introduction, and some reference material, to the three.\n\nPython\nIf you already have some coding background in a different language, the Python cheat sheet gives the essential overview of the language, while the official tutorial goes in depth.\nIf you have less programming experience, Google’s Python course is quite nice, or in case you would like something in video format, Microsoft has made a Python for beginners video series.\nHowever, in the end we can get away with limited Python knowledge, since the majority of our interaction with both the data and the ML models is through the set of libraries decribed below. And, given the modern tools at our disposal, we can always ask for help.\n\nHey ChatGPT, I already know Matlab, can you give me a super-short (like, really short) introduction to Python?\n\n\n\nRequired Python libraries\nThe main data structure we use for data-intensive tasks like ML is the array, provided by the NumPy (Numerical Python) library. It looks like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6]])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a.shape\n(2, 3)\nand allows for performing operations on each element without writing explicit for-loops:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a + 10\narray([[11, 12, 13],\n       [14, 15, 16]])\nWhile we will cover some NumPy basics during the workshop, the essentials are given in these two tutorials: NumPy quickstart, for those who are already familiar with Python, and NumPy basics for beginners for … well, beginners.\nTo perform all the computations involved in doing deep learning, we need a library that can do automatic differentiation and efficient matrix multiplications. A popular option is TensorFlow and its companion interface for building neural networks, Keras. A nice thing about Keras is the extensive example gallery, which serves as inspiration for solving loads of different tasks. While other options for deep learning frameworks have their benefits too, they mostly all follow similar syntax for data operations as NumPy, making it relatively easy to switch between them, as long as one knows NumPy.\n\n\nJupyter notebooks\nJupyter notebooks form a convenient way of prototyping code, by mixing code, text and graphics in a single document. The easiest option for running the exercise notebooks is through a cloud service, in which case there is nothing to install. Alternatives are (choose one):\n\nGoogle Colab (Preferred): Requires a Google account (like GMail), but otherwise free.\nKaggle Code: Requires an account, but otherwise free.\nInstall on our own machine: No accounts required, but setup may take a few minutes. Instructions are given in the Jupyter docs.\n\nThe notebooks are mostly self-explanatory, but the basics are also given in the Jupyter Notebook 101 course, and documented in detail on the Jupyter website."
